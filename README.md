# HCA Front End Dev Code Challenge

This application was put together for the HCA Front End Dev Code Challenge.
It integrates with the Google YouTube Data V3 API to display video from the HCA YouTube channels.

### The Application Should:

> - Display HCAs COVID-19 videos, with “COVID 19 Vaccine Podcast” videos always showing first in the list
> - Show HCA videos that are not COVID 19 related
> - Allows users to search a title within the context of a specific video grouping
> - Grant the user the ability to see information about a specific video before watching it
> - Grant ability to watch a video without leaving the page

### To Run the application:

> - Run npm install from your console to ensure all the package dependencies are properly installed
> - Go to clients folder through console and run npm install there to install all reactjs dependencies
> - Go to Google API and create your own personal API Key
> - Create a .env file in the source folder and API Key along with your required channel id and Port (8080)

### Notable Packages Used:

> 1. Material-UI v4: For styling
> 2. React Router: to navigate between pages
> 3. Axios: for get requests
> 4. Node Express: For API call handling and decoupling of API logic
> 5. Winston: For Error logging purposes
