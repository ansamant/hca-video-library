# HCA Front End Dev Code Challenge

This application was put together for the HCA Front End Dev Code Challenge. 
It integrates with the Google YouTube Data V3 API to display video from the HCA YouTube channels.

> * Show HCA videos that are not COVID 19 related
> * Allows users to search a title within the context of a specific video grouping
> * Grant the user the ability to see information about a specific video before watching it
> * Grant  ability to watch a video without leaving the page

### To Run the application:
> - Run npm install to ensure all the package dependencies are properly placed
> - Go to Google API and create your own personal API Key
> - Go to src/apis/youtube.js and assign your API key to the API_KEY variable
